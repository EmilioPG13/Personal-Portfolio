            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I am a self-taught developer who is passionate about entering the dynamic and ever-evolving world of
                programming. With a strong background in marketing, I have a deep understanding of how the market
                functions, which allows me to approach programming from a unique perspective. Moreover, I use the
                valuable skills and knowledge acquired during my college education to continuously refine and expand my
                programming expertise.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, I am diligently working on a comprehensive portfolio project that demonstrates my
                capabilities and serves as a gateway to attracting potential employers. By showcasing my diverse range
                of skills and projects, I aim to captivate employers and demonstrate my ability to deliver exceptional
                results. I firmly believe that this portfolio will not only impress prospective employers but also open
                up exciting career opportunities in the programming industry.</p>
